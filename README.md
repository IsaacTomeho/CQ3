# CQ3

Mini-Max Sum:
O(n) ; the algorithm includes a for loop which runs based on size of n (the array) and does constant time work. 

Hackerrank in String:
O(n^2) ; the algorithm includes a for loop which runs based on size of n (the string), does constant time work but is recursive so goes through the loop over and over again.
